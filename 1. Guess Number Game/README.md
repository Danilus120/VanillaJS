# Guess Number Game

First small project in JavaScript.

## How to use?

Enter the number and check that it matches the number drawn. If not, a text will appear telling you whether the number you entered is higher or lower than the number drawn.

If the number matches the drawn number, the result will count towards the highscore, the background of the application will change to green and the message "Correct Number!" will be displayed.

The score is calculated from 20 and a point is deducted each time the number entered is not identical to the number drawn.
